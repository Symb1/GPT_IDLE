# Creating an Idle/Clicker Game Using Plain English with GPT

***Hello everyone, especially clicker/idle game enthusiasts :)*** ðŸ‘‹

Before diving into the details of my recent project, I want to address the following first, can you create something similar? A game just by explaining your idea to the AI? ***Yes*** and ***no*** at the same time.

This was actually my second attempt doing something like this back when chatGPT 3.0 was free, unfortunately I failed.
While 3.0 version was enough to make the very basic functions/variables and game logic, creating complex game mechanics solely through natural language interactions proved to be beyond its capabilities, especially due to its response limitations and frequent amnesia ( which occurs now as well I might add )
However, with ChatGPT 3.5 being free now, creating at least a basic structure/framework, or transforming your idea into a functioning demo, is indeed **possible**. 

It's important to note, though, that there are still caveats. You need at least a basic understanding of your chosen programming language and being able to read through code can certainly help navigate the process **more effectively**. Without that, you won't be able to troubleshoot your project. 

So in summary, while the technology exists and the concept is viable, the process isn't as straightforward as "telling the AI to make a cool game for you" and expecting a fully functional game to emerge, alternatively, you might only need around a week, instead of months to learn about your chosen programming language and be able to create something functional and unique. With paid options like ChatGPT 4 or Anthropic's Claude most likely even less.
Let's dive into specifics now of general-purpose language models:

# Your free options:

 **Open AI's ChatGPT 3.5**:

- _Repetition_: ChatGPT very often repeats itself, even after instructing it not to, which can lead to redundant or unhelpful responses.
- _Gaslighting_: The AI may inadvertently gaslight you by suggesting incorrect solutions or questioning its instructions.
- _Looping_: ChatGPT will get stuck in loops as your code grows, cycling between incorrect solutions, even when explicitly told not to.
- _Complex Code Handling_: When confronted with complex code structures, ChatGPT may struggle to navigate effectively, leading to bloated or inefficient code generation.
- _Issues with Object-Oriented Programming_: ChatGPT tends to have difficulties with object-oriented programming languages in general.

**Anthropic's Claude free version**:

While I haven't tried chatGPT 4 I suspect their free version is on par with Claude's free model as it is more advanced and you can directly upload files to it.

- _Repetition_: Vastly reduced repetition in responses, providing more focused assistance.
- _Gaslighting_: Minimal gaslighting behavior, offering more reliable suggestions.
- _Looping_: Only gets stuck in loops when your code becomes a bit more complex, ensuring smoother problem-solving compared to chatGPT.
- Generally the ability to accommodate larger codebases with more complex logic.

ChatGPT 3.5 however is competely free while Claude has message limitations, nonetheless Claude is a lot better and its paid version is a powerhouse for coding compared even to chatGPT 4.0.


# My methodology:

I refrained from directly manipulating the code or making manual alterations, relying instead on AI to generate the framework and components of the game, what I did mostly was ctr+c and ctrl+v. ðŸ™‚

Unfortunately I encountered instances where I had to nudge AI towards resolving issues, such as pointing out specific functions or assisting in declaring global variables.

Additionally, graphics ( and by that I mean one picture ) were generated by AI, so was the game UI ( if you even can call it that ).

Sounds were not made by AI but they were freely available to download and use.

Furthermore, the text and tooltips, including abilities and lore, ( again if you can even call it "lore") were entirely crafted by AI.

When it came to game balance I had to do few tweaks myself, curate it a bit so that it can be playable.


# About the Game:

I implemented a twist on the typical clicker/idle game concept, where instead of endlessly increasing numbers, the goal is to decrease them through a Boss Mechanic, offering a finite experience.

Because it's technically a demo version or proof of a concept, it was designed for quick playthrough, with completion in under 20 minutes for active players, or around 1-2 hours for those semi-afk idle enjoyers and so the game currently lacks a save mechanic, so ***don't reload*** the page!

Early gameplay focuses on progressing through clicking only, requiring roughly 2000 clicks to progress before transitioning to idle gameplay.

It incorporates an ascend function for progression, achievements to unlock, and basic game stat tracking, sound and nightmode toggle and some extra mechanics to enhance your gameplay.

Also aded some auto-click restrictions.
